# PinkNoiseChugin
A Chugin that synthesizes the different types of Pink noise.

This Chugin was inspired by the conversation from the [music-dsp](http://www.firstpr.com.au/dsp/pink-noise/) mailing list.

It includes the following ways to synthesize Pink noise.

  * Filtered Pink Noise
  * Voss Pink Noise
  * Voss/McCartney Pink Noise
  * Stochastic Voss/McCartney Pink Noise
  * [A New Shade of Pink](https://github.com/Stenzel/newshadeofpink) (Stenzel Pink Noise)
